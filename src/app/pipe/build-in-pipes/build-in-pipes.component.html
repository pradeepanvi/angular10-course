<p>Angular provides built-in pipes for typical data transformations, including transformations for internationalization
    (i18n), which use locale information to format data. The following are commonly used built-in pipes for data
    formatting:</p>

<ul>
    <li>DatePipe: Formats a date value according to locale rules.</li>
    <li>UpperCasePipe: Transforms text to all upper case.</li>
    <li>LowerCasePipe: Transforms text to all lower case.</li>
    <li>CurrencyPipe: Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.</li>
    <li>DecimalPipe: Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.</li>
    <li>PercentPipe: Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.</li>
</ul>
