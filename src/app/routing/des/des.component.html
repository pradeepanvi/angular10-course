<ul>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="basic-routing">Defining a basic route:</a> The Angular CLI
    performs this step for you. However, if you are creating an app manually or
    working with an existing, non-CLI app, verify that the imports and
    configuration are correct. The following is the default AppModule using the
    CLI with the --routing flag.
  </li>
  <li>Router ActivatedRoute ParamMap</li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="wildcard">wildcard routes:</a> A well-functioning application
    should gracefully handle when users attempt to navigate to a part of your
    application that does not exist. To add this functionality to your
    application, you set up a wildcard route. The Angular router selects this
    route any time the requested URL doesn't match any router paths.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="redirects">redirects:</a> To set up a redirect, configure a
    route with the path you want to redirect from, the component you want to
    redirect to, and a pathMatch value that tells the router how to match the
    URL.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="nesting-routes">Nesting routes:</a> As your application grows
    more complex, you may want to create routes that are relative to a component
    other than your root component. These types of nested routes are called
    child routes. This means you're adding a second router-outlet to your app,
    because it is in addition to the router-outlet in AppComponent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="relative-paths">relative paths:</a> Relative paths allow you
    to define paths that are relative to the current URL segment. The following
    example shows a relative route to another component, second-component.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="query-parameters-and-fragments"
      >query parameters and fragments:</a
    >
    Sometimes, a feature of your application requires accessing a part of a
    route, such as a query parameter or a fragment. The Tour of Heroes app at
    this stage in the tutorial uses a list view in which you can click on a hero
    to see details. The router uses an id to show the correct hero's details.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="lazy-loading">Lazy loading:</a> You can configure your routes
    to lazy load modules, which means that Angular only loads modules as needed,
    rather than loading all modules when the app launches. Additionally, you can
    preload parts of your app in the background to improve the user experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="link-parameters-array">Link parameters array:</a> A link
    parameters array holds the following ingredients for router navigation: The
    path of the route to the destination component. Required and optional route
    parameters that go into the route URL.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      routerLink="locationStrategy-and-browser-URL-styles
"
      >LocationStrategy and browser URL styles:
    </a>
    When the router navigates to a new component view, it updates the browser's
    location and history with a URL for that view. As this is a strictly local
    URL the browser won't send this URL to the server and will not reload the
    page.
  </li>
</ul>
